# Introduction : 
Now-a-days communication has become a major part of a personâ€™s life and it is very important as it keep aware what is happening around the world and in the region where one lives. Keeping that in mind and our Network and Communication Project, we have done a project where we can establish a connection between a server and a client so that they can share things between them and could talk to each other by the means of texting each other.
In this project, we have written code in python to make our program. In that, the two systems need to connect to the same Wi-Fi-hotspot and one of the user is server while other is client and after the connection been established they can chat to each other by the means of texting, all a client needs to do is to connect on the same IP as of server and on the same port used by the server while making server and they can chat with each other.
